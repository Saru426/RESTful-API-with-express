# Express RESTful API

This is a sample project demonstrating the implementation of a RESTful API using Node.js and the Express framework. The API provides endpoints to perform CRUD operations on a specific resource.

## Features

- User authentication and authorization
- CRUD operations for managing the resource
- Validation of incoming request data
- Database integration and model/schema definitions
- Structured project organization

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB (or any other database of your choice)
- Mongoose (if using MongoDB as the database)
- Other necessary dependencies (check package.json for details)

## Project Structure

The project follows a modular structure to keep the codebase organized and maintainable. Here's an overview of the different directories and files:

- `server.js`: Main file that sets up the Express server and server configurations.
- `database/`: Directory containing files related to database connectivity and configurations.
- `config/`: Directory for managing configuration variables and settings.
- `validators/`: Directory for request data validation logic and middleware functions.
- `models/`: Directory for defining data models or schemas for the resource.
- `routes/`: Directory containing route files that define the API endpoints and associated logic.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install the dependencies: `npm install`
3. Configure the environment variables: Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and update the necessary variables.
4. Set up the database: Configure the database connection in `database/db.js` (or the corresponding file for your chosen database).
5. Start the server: `npm start`
6. The API will be accessible at `http://localhost:<port>`, where `<port>` is the port number specified in the server configuration.

## API Documentation

You can find detailed documentation for the API endpoints in the `routes/` directory. Each route file contains information about the routes, their methods, required authentication, and the associated controller functions.
